# S.M.-ArmMovmenet

## Control arm movmenet website
- An Arduino UNO project use Web Serial API to control a Robotic arm 
 it a web site to control a Robotic arm through Web Serial API and likned with the 

#### Part 1 (Web Serial API):
- build Speech to text (Arabic) website with serial devices (in this case Arduino UNO) communicate using Web Serial API which it will take the user commands and send them to the serial device useing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
#### Part 2 (Arduino):
- use of the Arduino `Servo` library set the Robot angles , connect andreceived the text command from the Web Serial API also adjust the arm Robot angles base on the command :
########  right (180 degree)
########  left (0 degree)

### Run:
-  Plug in Arduino UNO
-  Connect Servo Motor to pin 8

### Refrences:
- Web Serial API: https://web.dev/serial/
